# Vulpixelize

* The flag route can be embedded in an iframe and you will get a screen shot of if, but super pixilated
* Using css transform is possible to scale up the iframe 20x so that a few letters of the flag can be read
* The frame can then be moved with `translate` to read the next few characters
* Repeat for the whole flag
