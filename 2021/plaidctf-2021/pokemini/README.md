# Pokemini

This challenge is a PokeMini ROM. After reading the assembly to reverse it, you find that your input is xored, converted into a series of values [0, 9] which represent coordinates on a 10x10 board. These coordinates represent the path taken to solve a [Masyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyu) puzzle. To solve, put the puzzle into an online masyu solver, recover the path, and convert the path back to input to get the flag.
