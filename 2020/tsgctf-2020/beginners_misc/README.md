Beginner's Misc
===============

First we brute sets up 4 characters which produce valid utf-8 encoded strings on decoding.

Then we generate primitives to calculate various powers of two: 2, 1/2, 1/4, ...

Once we have these primitives, we can generate any floating point number we want using the binary representation.
